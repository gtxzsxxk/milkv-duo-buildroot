	  This package is obtained from
	  https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk,
	  from which we download the first stage bootloader source and
	  compile it, generating the ATF bl2.bin. At the mean time, we
	  will use the fiptool.py in this package to create the binary
	  file fip.bin to pack the opensbi, u-boot and so on.

	  If you intend to generate the whole sdcard image or the
	  fip.bin for milk-v duo, you must say Y to this package!

	  some packages automatically, to have the same experience
	  with the official release.
